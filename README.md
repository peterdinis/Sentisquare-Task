# TextRazor Dashboard

ðŸ“Š **TextRazor Dashboard** is a web application for uploading text files, analyzing text using the [TextRazor API](https://www.textrazor.com/), visualizing entities, and displaying statistics.  

Users can upload a `.txt` file, the app extracts entities (people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.), highlights them in the text, and displays charts of entity frequencies.

## Features

- Upload `.txt` files with multiple lines
- Asynchronous analysis of each line via TextRazor API (entities only)
- Display results:
  - Statistics: total entities, most frequent entity type, total lines
  - Charts showing frequency of each entity type
  - Highlighted entities directly in the text
- Toast notifications for success or errors
- Smooth animations for a better UX (Framer Motion)
